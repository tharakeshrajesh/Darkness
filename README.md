# Darkness Mod

A funny "horror" mod. Not really horror, but very annoying.

This mod adds a few things to make Minecraft more chaotic:

* A sleep deprivation system that messes with the day/night cycle.
* Random jumpscare sound effects to drive you insane.
* Eating beetroots may summon or kill **Black**, a very fast zombie that is tough to deal with and will chase you forever.
* Basically turns you into a gambler who bets their life every time they eat.

### Installation

* Requires [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/) and the [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api).
* Drop the `.jar` file (found in [releases](https://github.com/tharakeshrajesh/Darkness/releases/latest)) into your `mods/` folder.

### Notes

* Black is hard to kill.
* Don’t eat too many beetroots.
* You’ve been warned.
